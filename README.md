# HELLO So I just assembled breakout I as a dependency of breakout II as it mnay or may not have been intended, and then bubble bubble boil and trouble something coherengt along is a dozen plugins for visual studio 
and it asked to merege here and there and ta da... Iam not the most savy information technologist... just have a little too much time on my
hands, however there is something I would really like to know...

Could someone please explain to me how the calgo.system.reflection works... upon what outcomes does it reflect, and do I have to perpetually run visual studio to enable that feature? 
and how zaand when does the algorhythm optimise itself as it agregates new data!!?
